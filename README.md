# UsedCarDataset
This is a dataset I have worked on to showcase my data cleaning, data visulization, and data analysis skills.
The original dataset has been acquired from https://www.kaggle.com/ananaymital/us-used-cars-dataset, which had over 30 million observations and over 60 attributes. To narrow down the scale of the study, I have narrow our data set to the New York and Michigan areas, as it is the area of interest where the target business market is.
The rationale behind this analysis is to identify a model that would appropriately and reasonably price a used car within the dealership’s inventory, so that it reflects the current market with used cars around the states, maintains profit margin for the company, and minimizes the loss of car lot real-estate by fast sales. Several candidate factors were proposed, including the cars’ mileage, year, cars’ horsepower, days on market. These factors were chosen based on two business decision-making aspects: (1) customers’ needs (mileage, year, a car’s horsepower) and (2) the flow of the inventory (days on the market. The following business question is asked:
Business Question:
How do the number of mileages, years, horsepower, days on market predict the price of the used cars, so that the dealer can adjust the trajectory of predicted price for the used cars? 
There were three stages in the project:
  - Data Cleansing, Transformation, Architecture
  - Data Visualization
  - Data Analysis

In this project, I have included the following documents: 
  - Dataset named Used Car Smaller.csv
  - R code I used to conduct the three stages of data analysis
  - Final report
